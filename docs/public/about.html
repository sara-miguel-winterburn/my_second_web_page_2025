                <h2>My Studies</h2>
                <p>I am currently a first-year student studying
                    <a href="https://www.ufv.es/estudiar-grado-ingenieria-matematica-ingenieria-informatica-madrid/" target="_blank">
                        Mathematics and Computer Science Engineering
                    </a> 
                    at Francisco de Vitoria University, where I focus on foundational topics in mathematics, programming, and computer science, with an eye toward applications in various sectors, particularly in software development and finance.
                <p>My long-term career goal is still evolving, as I find myself drawn to various fields within the tech and finance sectors. I am currently exploring different career paths, such as becoming a Software Developer, Chief Data Officer, 
                    or Data Scientist, particularly in financial institutions, including hedge funds, where I could apply my data analysis skills to improve decision-making processes and optimize investment strategies. I also have an interest in 
                    Cybersecurity Engineering, particularly in high-tech companies, as the demand for robust security systems continues to grow. Additionally, the rise of quantum computing has sparked my curiosity about the potential of Quantum Finance 
                    to revolutionize the financial industry. While I am passionate about these areas, I am still in the process of narrowing down which path to focus on as I continue to learn more through my studies and experiences.</p>    
                <p>As for the current state of the industry, the demand for professionals with a strong foundation in data analysis, programming, and cybersecurity is on the rise, making it an exciting yet competitive field. Despite the competitive nature 
                    of the job market, I remain optimistic about the growing need for skilled professionals in tech, especially in sectors like finance, where innovation and technological advancements are key. I believe that gaining valuable experience in a 
                    reputable company is the first step towards achieving my goals, and in the future, I may even explore the possibility of starting my own company, provided I have gathered enough experience and have a solid idea that could make an impact.
                    Through my academic studies and extracurricular activities, I am continuously learning about emerging technologies and actively engaging in projects related to data science and software development. I am committed to developing a comprehensive 
                    skill set, including expertise in programming languages, data analysis techniques, and cybersecurity practices, to ensure I am well-prepared for the professional challenges ahead. Ultimately, my focus is on bridging the gap between theoretical 
                    knowledge and practical application, and I aspire to be part of a team or company that pushes the boundaries of innovation in the tech industry.</p>
